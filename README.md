# Business Analysis -- Personal Project

Date started: 01/07/2025

Date finished: 01/12/2025

Developed by: Sam Jeffery

Objective:

Demonstrate my ability to create an end to end Data Analysis project by analyzing sales data, identifying trends, answering questions, and visualizing key metrics.

# All using Python!

This program is NOT object oriented.

    1. Start by collecting data. For my own purposes, I will be pulling example sales data from Kaggle.

    2. Explore the data. Perform exploratory analysis, summary statistics, identify trends.

    3. Clean the data. Handle missing data, remove outliers by leveraging Z Scores or IQR, standardize all dates, currencies, and categorical variables.
    Assure all columns are descriptive and readable. 

    (For this project, the data was very clean!)

    4. Transform the data. Add calculated collumns and/or aggregations. Group data by categories. Use pivot tables or groupby operations.

    (Was not really necessary for this project.)

    5. Analyze Trends. Look for patterns, correlations, seasonality. Compare groups or categories to find differences. Use simple visualizations.

    6. Identify Key Insights. From the visualizations, identify and address unexpected trends, anomolies, and other key findings.
