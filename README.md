Developed by: Sam Jeffery

Objective:

Demonstrate my ability to create an end to end Data Analysis project by analyzing sales data, identifying trends, KPIs.
Then, visualize the data.

This program is NOT object oriented.

1. Start by collecting data. For my own purposes, I will be pulling example sales data from Kaggle.

2. Explore the data. Perform exploratory analysis, summary statistics, identify trends. Take note of any fields that are missing or invalid.

3. Clean the data. Handle missing data, remove outliers by leveraging Z Scores or IQR, standardize all dates, currencies, and categorical variables.
Assure all columns are descriptive and readable.

4. Transform the data. Add calculated collumns and/or aggregations. Group data by categories. Use pivot tables or groupby operations.

5. Analyze Trends. Look for patterns, correlations, seasonality. Compare groups or categories to find differences. Use simple visualizations.

6. Build a Dashboard. Using Tableau, BI, or Python-based dashboards like Dash or Streamlit. Include an overview, detailed sections, and interactability.

7. Identify Key Insights. From the visualizations, identify and address unexpected trends, anomolies, and other key findings.

8. Finally, Document and reflect on the process.
